# Primary Colours
**Accent colors**: Primary, secondary, and tertiary roles are formed following the same pattern of a 4-color group.

## Primary base color
- On-primary is applied to content (icons, text, etc.) that sits on top of primary
- Primary container is applied to elements needing less emphasis than primary
- On-primary container is applied to content (icons, text, etc.) that sits on top of primary container

Other color roles include:
- Semantic color role for error, again in the form of the error role itself
- Neutral roles are used for surfaces and backgrounds, as well as high emphasis text and icons.
- Example of custom color that can be added and translated into a group of four compatible tones

In total, core scheme colors and custom colors comprise your entire scheme.
You can choose which colors from the resulting scheme that you want to apply.
