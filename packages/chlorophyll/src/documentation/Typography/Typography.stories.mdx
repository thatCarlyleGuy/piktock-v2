# Type pairing
If you’ve found a typeface that works for your app, you may want to complement
it with a second typeface. If you’ve selected a bold display typeface to style
headlines, for example, you may want to find a more subtle and readable body
typeface to go along with it.

# Type Scale
The Material type scale provides fifteen styles to use across your app.
The styles are grouped into roles with small, medium, and large variations.
Styles can be customized to meet the needs of your brand and product.

# Customization
To customize the type scale, begin by applying your selected typefaces to the existing style categories, matching type size and weight first.

From there, make optical adjustments to line height and letter spacing values to accommodate the unique features of your custom typeface.

Heavier fonts may require wider letter spacing, while fonts with long ascenders and descenders will require different line heights.
